# Comments can be added using the # character
# This file works the same way as a language file,

# It's really simple, it's a key-value file with the following syntax:
# "key.which.is.a.double.quoted.string" = "Value which can be a String, char, long, double, boolean"

# The ID of this plugin, if more plugins have the same ID only one of them will be registered
"plugin.id" = "io.github.hds.pemu:ruby_processor"

# The name and version of this plugin, it's used to show the user a pretty name for the plugin
# It's usually "name:version" but can be changed by overloading the "toString" method
"plugin.name" = "Ruby Processor"
"plugin.version" = "1.1"
