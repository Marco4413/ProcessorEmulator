# Plugins

## What can a Plugin add to PEMU?

Plugins were added to make it possible to create other implementations of a Processor, so they are designed to do so.

**NOTE: Plugins are written in Java, so they can use EVERYTHING that a normal Java App can use, so they might be able
to harm your computer, so it's recommended to pick plugins with care.**

## How do I load a different Plugin?

It's really simple, you just need to open PEMU and go to `File -> Load Plugin` and select one from the drop down menu
and confirm your choice.

## How do I add Plugins to PEMU?

Plugins can be added by going into `User's Home Dir -> PEMU -> plugins` and dropping the Plugin's File.

 - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%/.pemu/plugins/`
 - Linux: `$HOME/.pemu/plugins/`
